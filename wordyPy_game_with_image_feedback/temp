This game is same as the wordypy_game_make_best_guess, but in place of returning a string as a feedback, the GameEngine returns an image as a feedback. The feedback image is color coded for each letter, blue represents the letter is in correct place, maize color represents the letter is in the word but not at a correct place and finally gray represents that the letter is not at all present in the word.
The task of Bot instance is to process the image and modify the wordlist based on the feedback and make a guess.
