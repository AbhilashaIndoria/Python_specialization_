# Python_specialization_
This repository contains the python programming assignments from the python learning specialization from university of Michigan. It includes variables, conditionals, and loops, list comprehensions, functions, class Inheritance and more. https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python-3-programming
 Assignments include creation of a simple sentiment analyzer to counts the number of positive and negative words in tweets. 
 Mashing up two APIs to create a movie recommender. 
 Use of  pillow, tesseract to perform optical character recognition (OCR) and object detection in images and build a game called wordypy.
WordyPy game has three variations:
WordyPy_make_best_guess- there is a target word randomly chosen and a Bot has 6 chances to guess the correct word based on certain feedback provided by another class. The feedback is in the string format.
Wordy_Py_Imagefeedback- gets the feedback in the form of image so the Bot has to process the image in order to process its guess.
WordyPy_best_guess_based_on_image_of_all_previous_guesses- task is to tell what is the next best guess that can be made if you have an image of all the pervious guesses.
The details of the games are provided in the temp files of each subdirectory.
